        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">Music Quest</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            The successor to RPGSim, Music Quest is a role-play game in which players 
            can battle random monsters, earn experience to level up, get coins to buy 
            new items, and proceed through the world until eventually beating the final 
            boss Rapula. This game was coded in Java and uses a graphics library made by 
            Dr. Gregory Neat, my AP Computer Science teacher in 9th grade. There's a lot 
            of stolen images and music in the game, but I'm not making any money off of 
            it and I am not that good at composing music. My brother likened it to Runescape, 
            in which opening the game with the intent to play it will get boring quickly, 
            but having it on the side while doing something else allows the player to 
            progress and pay more attention to key moment like new areas and bosses.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">ContactMe</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            ContactMe is an Android app that imports your phone's contacts, and you can 
            edit them on the app so that after the amount of time you select, a notification 
            will be sent for you to contact that person. This is helpful if you're the type 
            of person who, say, forgets to text their mom every week. There's also the events 
            system that functions more like a traditional calendar app, but allows you to add 
            certain contacts to associate with the events. This was submitted to the Congresional 
            App Challenge in 2023.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">The Fun Zone</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            The Fun Zone is a website I made with a collection of different games on it. 
            I only made one game, being Guess the Pokemon Type using Poke API. It's very 
            rudamentary, but it at least works. I copy-pasted everything else due to the 
            small amount of time I had to submit the project. I am not proud of it, but it 
            was my first experience in using JavaScript to perform functions in websites like 
            this. I later created a California DMV practice test with 40 official questions in 
            rotations to help me study for my permit.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">Based Beats</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            Based Beats is a rhythm game I made using PyGame, a library made for games with 
            graphicsi in Python. The game is quite similar to other rhythm games: "maps" with 
            chart and music files are loaded when the user selects them, the player uses 4 keys 
            (QWOP is the default) to hit notes falling on 4 different columns, and they gain a 
            different amount of points based on their accuracy. Where my game 
            shines is overall customizations. Users can adjust delay for audio, change keys, 
            adjust note colors, and create their own charts. Everything but the last one can 
            be done in-game, and even creating charts has a simple format.
            <br><br>
            At the top of the text file is the BPM. Each note is 1/8th of a beat, so songs 
            with 1/16th notes need to double the BPM to keep every note.<br>
            Each line of text after should have 4 numbers:<br>
            1 is a normal note.<br>
            2, 3, and 4 are the start, middle, and end of held notes respectively.<br>
            5 is a negative note, which punishes the player for hitting it.<br>
            For example:<br>
            1000<br>
            0100<br>
            0010<br>
            0001<br>
            starts with one note at the very left, and then a note on a column to its right 
            until it reaches the rightmost column.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">RC Car</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            My friend and I were paired together in a project for my Intro to Engineering 
            class, which you can find in the <a href="education.html">Education</a> page. 
            The assignment was only to make a car using an Arduino, but we went above and 
            beyond by purchasing an infrared controller and learning how to read IR signals 
            in Arduino, and it worked!
            <br><br>
            You can find the blog of it <a href="https://gregterteryan.github.io/p4-engineering/sem2proj1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">Cardboard Boat</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            This was weeks <a href="https://gregterteryan.github.io/p4-engineering/sem2week12.html" target="_blank">12</a>-<a href="https://gregterteryan.github.io/p4-engineering/sem2week17.html" target="_blank">17</a> & <a href="https://gregterteryan.github.io/p4-engineering/sem2week20.html" target="_blank">20</a> 
            of my Intro to Engineering class, which you can find in the <a href="education.html">Education</a> page.
            <br><br>
            Me and 3 group members were tasked with making a cardboard boat that could actually 
            support the weight of two of us. Thank goodness it was a group of four, because I'm 
            too heavy for any cardboard boat to carry with another person. The overall process 
            was fun, and I was mainly in charge of planning. Our boat ended up going across the 
            school pool once, which you can watch a video of on the page in <a href="https://gregterteryan.github.io/p4-engineering/sem2week20.html" target="_blank">my engineering website</a>.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">RPGSim</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            The predecessor to Music Quest, RPGSim was a role-play game with many of the 
            same mechanics as it, but instead of graphics, there's an items system in which 
            defeated monsters can drop random items that can then be sold. 
            <br><br>

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">Discord Server Profile Bot</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            This is a discord bot that I made that allows for custom profiles to be made for 
            server members, and they are different across servers. This feature is usually 
            locked to a Discord Nitro subscription, so I decided to make a bot to somewhat 
            bypass it.
            <br><br>
            You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/GregTerteryan/discord-server-profiler-bot" target="_blank">Github</a>.

        <button class="collapsibleception" style="display:none;">PO System</button>
        <p class="yapping" style="display:none;">
            Recently, I've been in contact with the owner of a local business to create and 
            test a new PO system. Currently, their "system" is just a cash register that is 
            somewhat weird to use. So, I've been working on a mobile app that does many things 
            better:
            <br><br>
            1. Use barcodes and a scanner to make adding prices easier. <br>
            2. Have the option for a discount. <br>
            3. Store logs of transactions, be able to edit or remove if necessary, and export them on request.
            <br><br>
            The app is currently in its alpha phase of testing, in that individual functions 
            work fine, but it's now being tested on-site. Any changes that need to be made 
            are made known to me, and then I fix them and send a patch to the owner.
            <br><br>
            I will disclose the location of said business with the owner's permission.
