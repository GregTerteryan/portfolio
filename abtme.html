                About Me

        <p class="yapping">
            <i>Hi!</i> My name is Greg Terteryan! I'm an Armenian American, and if 
            you've seen other parts of my portfolio, you know that I'm quite the 
            computer... <i>enthusiast?</i>
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            My love for computer technology goes way 
            back to when I was a child. It wasn't anything like "I got to see how 
            computers were made and what make them tick," it was more like, "I saw 
            a computer, pondered for a little bit, and then wondered how they 
            worked."
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            While my curiousity for <i>how</i> they worked wasn't a big 
            priority then, I was still fascinated and in love with <i>the fact that 
            they <b>worked.</b></i> Such an incredible culmination of knowledge from 
            many different people, all coming together to create such a wonderful tool! 
            That and my undying love of video games is what set the stage for where I 
            am now.
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            I'm also quite interested in the ocean and marine life. Just the fact that 
            organisms have been able to adapt in many different ways to such a vast array 
            of odd environments. I'm also a big proponent of using nature as an inspiration 
            for engineering, and the many organic mechanisms used by marine life could also 
            be used by humans to make things more efficient.
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            Some fun facts about me:
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            My favorite color is <b style="color:red">red</b>, my two favorite 
            fonts are Comfortaa and <b style="font-family:Power Clear;">Power Clear</b> 
            (which is probably obvious), and my favorite video game is 
            <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. 
            I also love Minecraft and Roblox for the incredible amount of things that 
            other super creative and smart people have made on it. One of my friends helped 
            develop a Roblox game called Combat Initiation, and it's my favorite one on the 
            platform. I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gt_eternity" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> 
            where I make Roblox animations, edits of games I play, and memes.
        </p>
        <p class="yapping">
            For those who haven't seen me, I am actually quite fat, which is something 
            I've working to change for over 2 years now. I've been regularly going to the 
            gym, only skipping it when school REALLY starts to pick up. I actually enjoy 
            working out, and weightlifting is one of my favorite activities. However, I 
            really hate it when a bunch of people are using all of the machines I plan to 
            use that day. When that happens, I just go do another half hour of cardio to 
            round it out to a full hour. Should I have my own personal gym, I would probably 
            spend a LOT more time in it, and maybe even have a dedicated Workout Sunday every 
            week.
